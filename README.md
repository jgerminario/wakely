Wakely (beta)
======
Wakely helps you to wake up with social incentivization. After linking your Twitter account, set up a time to wake up and a distance to walk. If you cannot make it past that distance, an embarrassing tweet will be sent to your followers.

Twitter access can be revoked at any time from your Twitter application settings. Wakely will never write or read from your account outside of your approved wake-up tweet.

Owing to server costs, Wakely is only online between 8 p.m. and 11 a.m. The unstyled MVP is deployed on Heroku at wakely.herokuapp.com and is fully functional, with Sidekiq/Redis-based background jobs running the Twitter event checks. A styled version is available in prototype form upon request, and will be released live by the end of February.

Please report any bugs or feedback to jgerminario@gmail.com. Happy waking!
